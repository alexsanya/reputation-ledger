🧾 Solana Reputation Ledger
A trustless reputation system for service providers—built on Solana.

🔍 What Is It?
A blockchain-based reputation ledger that brings full transparency to online services. Every interaction—quote, delivery, payment, and feedback—is recorded on-chain, publicly visible, and immutable.

🛠 Use Cases
✅ One-time freelance jobs

🔐 Crypto API gateways

🤝 Any service requiring prepayment and proof-of-work delivery

💡 Why This Matters
Before you hire someone or pay for a service, wouldn’t it be nice to:

Browse their past work history?

See whether past clients were happy?

Know you can get a refund if things go wrong?

This project enables exactly that—on-chain. No middlemen, no fake reviews, no hidden deals.

🔄 Workflow
Client Requests a Quote
Sends order data off-chain to the service provider.

Service Responds
Provides a signed offer including price, deadline, and expiration.

Client Accepts
Locks funds on-chain using the service’s signed offer.

Service Delivers
Commits the output hash on-chain to claim the locked funds.

Time Check
If the deadline passes with no delivery, client can claim a full refund.

Client Feedback
If the result is poor, client can mark the order as “unsatisfied” on-chain.

📖 What’s Recorded On-Chain?
🔎 What was ordered

📦 What was delivered (hash)

💰 What it cost

⏱ How long it took

😊 Was the client satisfied?

🔐 Trust Through Transparency
The system doesn’t enforce quality—but it makes everything visible:

Any client can audit past jobs

Anyone can verify feedback claims

Reputation is earned, not gamed

📌 Project Goals
Build an open, inspectable on-chain reputation layer

Encourage better service through visibility, not censorship

Enable crypto-native commerce with built-in accountability

🚧 Status
🔧 Still in early development. Core program logic is being implemented in Anchor framework.
